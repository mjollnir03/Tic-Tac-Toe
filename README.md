# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

This project lets you verse against an unbeatable AI in Tic Tac Toe. Built using **TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and Vite**.

Itâ€™s just like any other simple game of tic tac toe, but the purpose was for me to get an understanding of how React applications are built. Reactâ€™s basic tutorial to learn React is also a tic tac toe game, but instead of following that, I decided to make my own version. In the process, I learned more about React, especially component-based UI and state management using hooks.

You will never be able to beat the AI in this game thatâ€™s the whole point of the **Minimax algorithm**. It makes the AI choose the most optimal move every time.

## Live App

## References

Sebastian Lagueâ€™s video [**Minimax Algorithm Explained**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) is what influenced my minimax algorithm. I didnâ€™t add alpha-beta pruning since the search space in Tic Tac Toe is small enough to work fine without it.

## Conclusion

This project helped me learn how React apps are put together. I got a better idea of how components, hooks, and state all work together, and I was also able to separate the game logic (TypeScript classes) from the UI (React).

This project also allowed me to experiment with **GitHub Actions**, deploying projects to GitHub Pages using workflows.

## Work in Progress

-   Add different levels of difficulty for the AI
-   Add animations and colors to the cells
